				   Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle
				   of Divide and Conquer. 
				   Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist 
				   consists of a single element. 
				   And merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.
