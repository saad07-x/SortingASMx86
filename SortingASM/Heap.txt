                  Heap sort is one of the sorting algorithms used to arrange a list of elements in order. 
                  Heapsort algorithm uses one of the tree concepts called Heap Tree. In this sorting 
                  algorithm, we use Max Heap to arrange list of elements in Descending order and Min Heap
                  to arrange list elements in Ascending order.
